1. Rename cudaMPbTools to cudaMPb - ok
2. Rename cudaimage to cudampb - ok
3. Create cpuMPb - ok
4. Create test program for cudaMPb and gpuMPb - ok 
5. Autodetect how many blocks are available and how many threads can be inside a block
6. Implement cudaMPb in a grid - ok 
7. Compare cudaMPb with cpuMPb. Let the algorithms run on the same images and compare the results.
8. Pass parameters by reference in kernel
